#### The right methods

We work TDD and love continuous development. We have customers worldwide, working with our remote teams to support them everyday with the best tools available.

Coders51 continues to promote several initiatives that have helped to establish Elixir in several areas. We created [italian-elixir][6] to promote various events, meetups, conferences. We do coaching both on TDD working methods, agile, and languages. In 2015 we inaugurated the unique Italian Elixir/Erlang Day. It was such a success that we followed up with 2016 and 2017 editions. We believe that by working with the community and sharing skills and know-how with them, we can help Elixir achieve its rightful place in business.

### Developers know our Elixir way of thinking ;)

Here is an extract from our last talk in Stockholm Code Beam

"In this talk, I'll explain how current web applications are no longer merely DB projections, but more complex and distributed applications that require technologies and architectures unlike those of the past. We start with a simple & classic application and move toward a more complex and feature-rich application that needs a more advanced architecture."
